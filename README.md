# h1n1_vaccine_prediction
A Data Science Project

Project Overview
The h1n1_vaccine_prediction project is a data science initiative aimed at predicting the likelihood of individuals receiving the H1N1 vaccine using classification techniques. Leveraging machine learning algorithms, this project aims to analyze various factors influencing vaccination decisions and predict whether a person is likely to get vaccinated against H1N1.

Features
Data Collection: Utilizes datasets containing demographic, behavioral, and health-related attributes of individuals.
Preprocessing: Handles data cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering to prepare the dataset for modeling.
Modeling: Implements and evaluates several classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines.
Evaluation: Assesses model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualization: Provides insights through visualizations to understand feature importance and model performance.
